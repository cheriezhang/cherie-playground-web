          <p>Somewhere past my thirties, life suddenly slowed down. </p>
          <p>
            For the first time in a long while, I had the space to breathe—to
            reflect, to organize what I’ve learned, and to reconnect with what I
            love.
          </p>
          <p>That’s when this blog quietly came to life. </p>
          <p>
            It’s a place of my own, where I write both code and words; where I
            document not just knowledge, but thoughts, fragments, and questions.
            This blog has three chapters:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>1. Notes and reflections from front-end development</li>
            <li>2. Essays and musings from life outside the screen</li>
            <li>3. A small lab of experiments with AI </li>
          </ul>
          <p>It may not be systematic. It’s not perfect. But it’s real. </p>A
          notebook in progress, capturing both the path of learning and the
          shape of my becoming. Written for myself, and for you—the one who
          wandered in.
          <p>
            If you paused for a moment on any page here, maybe we’ve already
            shared something soft and quiet, across time and space.
